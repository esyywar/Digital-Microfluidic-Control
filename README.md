# ProtoDrop

ProtoDrop is an inexpensive and easy-to-assemble tool to perform digital microfluidic experiments.

The PCB uses readily available electrical components and the popular Arduino Nano microcontroller.

Firmware is easy to upload using the Arduino IDE and an intuitive LabVIEW GUI executable can be run on any Window's machine.

To get ProtoDrop up and running, you must complete 3 main tasks which are detailed in this guide:
  1. Assemble the electrical hardware
  1. Upload firmware
  1. Install software
  1. Connect high voltage and experiment!
